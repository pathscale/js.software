# Project Guidelines

## Code Style
- NEVER add comments to code unless explicitly requested
- No explanatory comments, section headers, or organizational comments
- Keep code clean and self-documenting through clear variable/function names
- Only add comments when absolutely necessary for complex logic explanation

## Writing Style
- Be concise and direct
- Focus on implementation, not explanation
- Avoid unnecessary verbosity
